# testflight

```shell
$ launch testflight
```

The `testflight` action will compile your Cordova build for iOS to be distributed in the App Store, sign it using your certificate, and upload it to TestFlight so you can test it, or ship it.

## Setup

You will need to have set up an application through [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com).

There is no additional setup required if you have already provided the information described in the [build](actions/build.md) action. Just let it fly!
